# Doodle Jump Assembly Project Overview
In this University project, we implemented the popular mobile game Doodle Jump (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doodle_Jump) from scratch using MIPS assembly. 
We run our implementation in a simulated environment within MARS, i.e., a simulated bitmap display and a simulated keyboard input.

Description:

The player presses the key "j" to make the Doodler move to the left and pressed the key "k" to move to the right, When no key is pressed, the Doodler falls straight down until it hits a platform or the bottom of the screen. If it hits a platform, the Doodler bounces up high into the air, but if the Doodler hits the bottom of the screen, the game ends.

# Tasks/Features Completed:
- The Doodler and the platforms are properly drawn (statically) on the screen.
- The movement controls of the Doodler and the platforms (by the keyboard and timers) are properly implemented.
- The Doodler can overlap and reappear on the opposite end of the screen
- Display the score in the console. The score should be constantly updated as the game progresses.
- More platform types, such as moving blocks (we implemented clouds) Different types of clouds are distinguished by different colors.
- Opponents / lethal creatures that can move and hurt the Doodler. (Storm Clouds)
- Dynamic background: dynamically changing background during the game (e.g., clouds moving horizontally). The movement must be different from that of the platforms.
- Changing difficulty as the game progresses: gradually increase the difficulty of the game (e.g., shrinking the platforms) as the game progresses.
